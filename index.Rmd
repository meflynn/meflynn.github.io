My name is Michael Flynn. I'm currently an associate professor of political science at Kansas State University. My research focuses primarily on the political economy of states' foreign policy behavior. I am currently working on two long-term projects focusing on the politics of US overseas military deployments, and another focusing on the differences in Republican and Democratic positions on  multilateralism in US foreign policy over time. I also edit and contribute to the Quantitative Peace, a blog dedicated to political science, science fiction, pop culture, and other random thoughts.
